        <h2>Exploring the Impact of Augmented Reality Interfaces on User Experience in HCI</h2>
        <h3>COIS 3560H - Human Computer Interaction</h3>
        <p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Samaksh Monga<br><strong>Date:</strong> Mar - Apr 2024</p>
        <p>
                        This project investigates the impact of Augmented Reality (AR)
                        interfaces on user experience (UX) within the realm of
                        Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). By examining how AR enhances
                        user interactions by blending the physical and digital worlds,
                        the research aims to understand its influence on usability,
                        engagement, and accessibility across various sectors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The project explores how AR is applied in fields such as safety,
                        mobile navigation, personalized training, and language learning,
                        highlighting its potential to transform industries like gaming,
                        education, healthcare, and manufacturing. Through a combination
                        of surveys, interviews, and usability testing, the project
                        evaluates user preferences, challenges, and expectations,
                        offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of
                        current AR interfaces.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The goal of this research is to provide a deeper understanding
                        of how AR can be integrated into user-centered designs,
                        ultimately contributing to the development of more intuitive,
                        engaging, and effective AR experiences.

        <h2>SimPy vs GPSS: A Comparative Study</h2>
        <h3>COIS 4470H - Modelling and Simulation</h3>
        <p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Samaksh Monga<br><strong>Date:</strong> Mar - Apr 2024</p>
        <h4>Key Highlights:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>SimPy:</strong> A Python-based, open-source framework that offers flexibility and
                            ease of use for simulating complex systems like queuing systems, inventory management, and
                            healthcare models. It is designed for seamless integration with the extensive Python
                            ecosystem.</li>
                        <li><strong>GPSS:</strong> A long-established simulation language developed in the 1960s for
                            discrete event modeling, especially in manufacturing and telecommunications. Known for its
                            simplicity and efficiency in system modeling, GPSS excels at hierarchical modeling and
                            predefined statistical functions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Through hands-on experimentation, I analyzed the built-in features, implementation techniques,
                        input/output mechanisms, and system efficiency of both tools. This analysis was supported by
                        practical examples and visual demonstrations of each language's capabilities.</p>

                    <h4>Skills Demonstrated:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comparative analysis of simulation frameworks</li>
                        <li>Hands-on modeling with both SimPy and GPSS</li>
                        <li>Creating simulation models for discrete event systems</li>
                        <li>Analyzing and presenting complex system behaviors through simulation results</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This project provided valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, offering
                        a clearer perspective on when to use SimPy or GPSS based on specific simulation needs.</p>
