Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Specifically for India)

Objectives:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis of India specific data that is available on Climate Trace and Google Earth Engine.
2. Uncover interesting insights that can guide research at Atria University.
3. Collaborated closely with professors to align tasks with the overall project objectives.


Data:
1. global: contains data downloaded from the resources available on Climate TRACE for entire World (https://climatetrace.org/inventory?year_from=2015&year_to=2022&gas=co2e100) and India (https://climatetrace.org/inventory?country=IND&year_from=2015&year_to=2022&gas=co2e100)
2. IND: contains data specific to India and its sector (available from Climate TRACE - https://climatetrace.org/data under Country -> India)
3. Google Earth Engine (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/)


Performed tasks
1. Facilitated practical applications, leading to an improvement in problem-solving towards project objectives
2. Data sources: ClimateTrace (https://climatetrace.org/) and Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/) - the tool which provides valuable insights into climate-related factors for a specific geographic area.  
3. Programming languages used: Python, JavaScript
4. Programming task: Given any latitude and longitude, we try to find the environmental profile (air quality, greenhouse emissions, etc) of a buffer land size around it.


Description
1. Programs made were interactive with the user (to allow input data for specific tasks and navigate through a menu of options to generate insights from the emissions data) and involved (i) the development of an environmental analysis tool using Google    Earth Engine and Python, which processed satellite data to calculate air and water quality, land use, temperature, and vegetation metrics, and (ii) analyzing environmental data, particularly emissions, which included functionalities to calculate emissions profiles from a CSV file, determine if a point lies within a geographical grid, plot total emissions by sector and gas, and identify top polluting sources.
2. Worked using Google Cloud Project in order to authenticate and register access to Google Earth Engine Servers.
