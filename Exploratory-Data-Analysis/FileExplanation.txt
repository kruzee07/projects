Explanation:

1. Function is_within_grid_corrected:

This function checks if a given point (point_lat, point_lon) is within a grid of size grid_size_km centered at (center_lat, center_lon).
It calculates the bounding box based on latitude and longitude conversions, then checks if the point lies within this box.
It prints whether the point is within the grid and also prints the bounding box coordinates.

2. Function calculate_emissions_profile:

This function calculates emissions profiles for a specified grid cell over multiple years.
It loads emissions data from a CSV file and creates a GeoDataFrame.
It calculates the bounding box for the specified grid cell using the provided cell_x_min, cell_y_min, and cell_size.
It performs a spatial join to find emissions sources within the grid cell for each year of interest.
It aggregates emissions by gas type and stores the emissions profile for each year.

3. Function calculate_emissions_profiles:

This function calculates emissions profiles for aggregated grid cells over multiple years as specified by the user.
It loads emissions data from a CSV file and creates a GeoDataFrame.
It prompts the user for grid cell coordinates (cell_x_min, cell_y_min) and size (cell_size_km).
It prompts the user for a list of years of interest (years_of_interest).
It creates a bounding box for the initial grid cell and performs a spatial join to find emissions sources within each grid cell for each year.
It aggregates emissions by gas type and prints the emissions profiles for each grid cell for each year.

4. Function plot_total_emissions_by_gas_and_sector:

This function plots total greenhouse gas emissions by sector for a specified year.
It loads emissions data from a CSV file, cleans the data, and calculates the total emissions by gas type and sector.
It plots the data using Seaborn's bar-plot, showing emissions quantity on the x-axis and sector on the y-axis, with different gas types represented by color.

5. Function main:

This is the main function of the application.
It presents a menu of options for the user to choose from: checking if a point is within a grid, calculating emissions profiles for a specified grid cell, calculating emissions profiles for aggregated grid cells over multiple years, plotting total greenhouse gas emissions by sector for a specified year, or exiting the application.
It prompts the user for input based on their choice and calls the appropriate function.


6. plot_total_emissions_by_subsector Function:

Modified to accept file_path and gas as parameters.
Handles loading, cleaning, and processing of the CSV data.
Defines inner function plot_total_emissions to plot emissions data by subsector for a specified gas.

-> In Menu:
Prompts the user for the file path to the emissions data CSV.
Implements a loop for menu-driven interaction:
Allows users to choose which type of emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O, CO2e) they want to visualize.
Calls plot_total_emissions_by_subsector with the specified parameters based on user input.

7. find_top_polluting_sources Function: 
This function encapsulates all the operations previously spread across multiple code blocks:

It takes file_path as input, which specifies the path to the CSV file containing emissions data.
Inside a try-except block, it:
Loads the data from the CSV file into a DataFrame.
Cleans and pre-processes the data, ensuring NaN values are handled appropriately.
Defines an inner function top_polluting_sources to find the top 4 most polluting sources for a given greenhouse gas, excluding specified sources like 'India'.
Iterates over each greenhouse gas present in the dataset, calls top_polluting_sources to obtain the results, and prints them.
Usage: To incorporate this function into your menu-driven application (in a separate file like menu.py), you would:
