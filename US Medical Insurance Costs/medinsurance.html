                        <h2>Analysis</h2>
                        <p>I have performed some basic and intermediate analysis on the given data. <br>
                            From the dataset, is it possible to conduct various number of analysis ranging from
                            the use of just one attribute to all of them. For this project, I am performing (writing)
                            few
                            functions or doing mathematical calculations to analyze and further visualize my findings.
                            <br>Our data with highest interest is the charges column which is the ultimate base of
                            this research file (most analysis includes this column).
                            <h4>Analysis that I performed</h4>

                    <section id="evaluation">

                        <p>
                             <h3>Analysis 1 - Whether smokers have higher medical charges than non-smokers</h3>
                            <h4>Data calculated</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The total number of people in dataset = 1338</li>
                            <li>Total number of males and females = 676, 662 respectively</li>
                            <li>Total number of smokers and non-smokers = 274, 1064 respectively</li>
                            <li>Total number of male smokers and female smokers = 159, 115 respectively</li>
                            <li>The total medical charges = $17,755,824.99</li>
                            <li>The total medical charges for smokers and non-smokers = $8781763.52, $8974061.47
                                respectively</li>
                            <li>The average charges for smokers and non-smokers = $32050.23, $8434.27 respectively</li>
                        </ul>
                        For this finding, I went deep to find out all the small scale calculations part required for
                        this analysis.
                        The analysis turned out to be more mathematical than programmable.<br>
                        Concluding with our findings, the results show that smokers had a higher average medical charge
                        than the non-smokers.
                        Although the total charges for each group were near about the same, due to a small number of
                        smokers in the dataset, their average charge soared.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h3>Analysis 2 - How the medical charges change with age</h3>
                            <h4>Data calculated</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Age 54 had the highest total medical charges across US of $63770.43</li>
                            <li>Age 18 had the lowest total medical charges across US of $1121.87</li>
                            <li>Age 64 had the highest average medical charges across US of $23275.53 per person</li>
                            <li>Age 21 had the lowest average medical charges across US of $4730.46 per person</li>
                        </ul>
                        With that and the plotted graph, we can see that in entirety, the average medical charges per
                        person increases with age.<br>
                        Here I have created several functions to perform analysis on the dataset with the given project
                        scope. In turn I also plotted a line graph
                        to visualize the findings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h3>Analysis 3 - How BMI across different regions of the US affect medical charges</h3>
                            <h4>Data calculated</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The BMI with the highest medical charge is 47.41</li>
                                    <li>The BMI with the lowest medical charge is 23.21</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>The average charges for each BMI range are</strong>
                                    <li>Underweight = $8852.20</li>
                                    <li>Healthy Weight = $10379.50</li>
                                    <li>Overweight = $11017.60</li>
                                    <li>Obesity = $15448.68</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>The average charges for each region are</strong>
                                   <li>NorthWest = $12417.58</li>
                                    <li>NorthEast = $13406.38</li>
                                    <li>SouthEast = $14735.41</li>
                                    <li>SouthWest = $12346.94</li>
                            </ul>
                            The pie charts in the diagram (scroll below to Outputs -> Analysis 3) show the distribution of BMIs (percentages) across each different region of the dataset.
                            <br>
                            We can fairly conclude that a large portion of the US is obese and overweight and a very minute portion is underweight or healthy.
                            <br>
                            What is also peculiar is that the average medical charges increase as we go from low BMI (underweight) towards high BMI (obesity), disregarding the fact that there is a healthy BMI range in between.
                            <br>
                            The average medical charges across the four regions are also very similar, the highest however being for the South East region, and the lowest for the South West.

                            <h3>Analysis 4 - Trend between number of children of person and medical charges</h3>
                            <h4>Data calculated</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Total people with no children: 574</li>

                                <li>Average medical charges for people with two children: $15073.56</li>
                                <li>Average medical charges for people with three children: $15355.32</li>
                                <li>Average medical charges for people with four children: $13850.66</li>
                                <li>Average medical charges for people with five children: $8786.04</li>

                                <li>The maximum charge for people with 5 (user input) children = $19023.26</li>
                                <li>The minimum charge for people with 1 (user input) children = $1711.03</li>
                            </ul>
                            The bar chart (scroll below to Outputs -> Analysis 4), shows how the average medical charge differs for people with different number of children.
                            <br>
                            The people with 3 children have the highest medical charges, whereas the people with 5 children have the lowest charges. 
                            However, considering the real world, even if the people with 5 children on average are saving up on their medical charges, their living expenses and education costs for their children
                            would on average be greater than those with fewer children.
