                    <p>For this project, I investigated a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file
                        (insurance.csv)
                        using the Python skills that I have developed so far.
                        This project was programmed using the Visual Studio Code editor and
                        has been pushed to my Github repo.</p>

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>

                    <p>I have performed some basic and intermediate analysis on the given data. <br>
                        From the dataset, it is possible to conduct various analyses ranging from
                        the use of just one attribute to all of them. For this project, I am performing (writing)
                        functions or doing mathematical calculations to analyze and further visualize my findings.
                        <br>Our data with the highest interest is the charges column, which is the ultimate base of
                        this research file (most analysis includes this column).
                    </p>

                    <h4>Analysis that I performed</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whether smokers have higher medical charges than non-smokers.</li>
                        <li>How the medical charges change with age.</li>
                        <li>How BMI across different regions of the US affect medical charges.</li>
                        <li>The trend between the number of children and medical charges.</li>

                <!-- Continue with other sections similarly -->

                <div class="section-box" id="evaluation">
                    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
                    <p>
                    <h3>Analysis 1 - Whether smokers have higher medical charges than non-smokers</h3>
                    <h4>Data calculated</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The total number of people in dataset = 1338</li>
                        <li>Total number of males and females = 676, 662 respectively</li>
                        <li>Total number of smokers and non-smokers = 274, 1064 respectively</li>
                        <li>Total number of male smokers and female smokers = 159, 115 respectively</li>
                        <li>The total medical charges = $17,755,824.99</li>
                        <li>The total medical charges for smokers and non-smokers = $8781763.52, $8974061.47
                            respectively</li>
                        <li>The average charges for smokers and non-smokers = $32050.23, $8434.27 respectively</li>
                    </ul>
                    For this finding, I went deep to find out all the small scale calculations part required for
                    this analysis.
                    The analysis turned out to be more mathematical than programmable.<br>
                    Concluding with our findings, the results show that smokers had a higher average medical charge
                    than the non-smokers.
                    Although the total charges for each group were near about the same, due to a small number of
                    smokers in the dataset, their average charge soared.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h3>Analysis 2 - How the medical charges change with age</h3>
                    <h4>Data calculated</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age 54 had the highest total medical charges across US of $63770.43</li>
                        <li>Age 18 had the lowest total medical charges across US of $1121.87</li>
                        <li>Age 64 had the highest average medical charges across US of $23275.53 per person</li>
                        <li>Age 21 had the lowest average medical charges across US of $4730.46 per person</li>
                    </ul>
                    With that and the plotted graph, we can see that in entirety, the average medical charges per
                    person increases with age.<br>
                    Here I have created several functions to perform analysis on the dataset with the given project
                    scope. In turn I also plotted a line graph
                    to visualize the findings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h3>Analysis 3 - How BMI across different regions of the US affect medical charges</h3>
                    <h4>Data calculated</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The BMI with the highest medical charge is 47.41</li>
                        <li>The BMI with the lowest medical charge is 23.21</li>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The average charges for each BMI range are</strong>
                        <li>Underweight = $8852.20</li>
                        <li>Healthy Weight = $10379.50</li>
                        <li>Overweight = $11017.60</li>
                        <li>Obesity = $15448.68</li>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The average charges for each region are</strong>
                        <li>NorthWest = $12417.58</li>
                        <li>NorthEast = $13406.38</li>
                        <li>SouthEast = $14735.41</li>
                        <li>SouthWest = $12346.94</li>
                    </ul>
                    The pie charts in the diagram (scroll below to Outputs -> Analysis 3) show the distribution of BMIs
                    (percentages) across each different region of the dataset.
                    <br>
                    We can fairly conclude that a large portion of the US is obese and overweight and a very minute
                    portion is underweight or healthy.
                    <br>
                    What is also peculiar is that the average medical charges increase as we go from low BMI
                    (underweight) towards high BMI (obesity), disregarding the fact that there is a healthy BMI range in
                    between.
                    <br>
                    The average medical charges across the four regions are also very similar, the highest however being
                    for the South East region, and the lowest for the South West.
                    </p>

                    The bar chart (scroll below to Outputs -> Analysis 4), shows how the average medical charge differs
                    for people with different number of children.
                    <br>
                    The people with 3 children have the highest medical charges, whereas the people with 5 children have
                    the lowest charges.
                    However, considering the real world, even if the people with 5 children on average are saving up on
                    their medical charges, their living expenses and education costs for their children
                    would on average be greater than those with fewer children.

                    <p>
                        Those wanting to use this dataset can further study a mix of data:<br>
                        For example: males and females within a specified BMI, people with a certain number of children
                        in a specific US region.<br>
                        There are many such example studies one can expand upon.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you are from a certain field: <br>
                        Healthcare - might want to focus on smoking data, BMI data, number of children.<br>
                        Government services - region data, sex data, charges data.<br>
                        Finance - might want to focus on medical charges, region data, sex data.
