                    <p>
                        This project investigates the impact of Augmented Reality (AR)
                        interfaces on user experience (UX) within the realm of
                        Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). By examining how AR enhances
                        user interactions by blending the physical and digital worlds,
                        the research aims to understand its influence on usability,
                        engagement, and accessibility across various sectors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The project explores how AR is applied in fields such as safety,
                        mobile navigation, personalized training, and language learning,
                        highlighting its potential to transform industries like gaming,
                        education, healthcare, and manufacturing. Through a combination
                        of surveys, interviews, and usability testing, the project
                        evaluates user preferences, challenges, and expectations,
                        offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of
                        current AR interfaces.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The goal of this research is to provide a deeper understanding
                        of how AR can be integrated into user-centered designs,
                        ultimately contributing to the development of more intuitive,
                        engaging, and effective AR experiences.

                    <h4>Key Highlights:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>SimPy:</strong> A Python-based, open-source framework that offers flexibility and
                            ease of use for simulating complex systems like queuing systems, inventory management, and
                            healthcare models. It is designed for seamless integration with the extensive Python
                            ecosystem.</li>
                        <li><strong>GPSS:</strong> A long-established simulation language developed in the 1960s for
                            discrete event modeling, especially in manufacturing and telecommunications. Known for its
                            simplicity and efficiency in system modeling, GPSS excels at hierarchical modeling and
                            predefined statistical functions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Through hands-on experimentation, I analyzed the built-in features, implementation techniques,
                        input/output mechanisms, and system efficiency of both tools. This analysis was supported by
                        practical examples and visual demonstrations of each language's capabilities.</p>

                    <h4>Skills Demonstrated:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comparative analysis of simulation frameworks</li>
                        <li>Hands-on modeling with both SimPy and GPSS</li>
                        <li>Creating simulation models for discrete event systems</li>
                        <li>Analyzing and presenting complex system behaviors through simulation results</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This project provided valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, offering
                        a clearer perspective on when to use SimPy or GPSS based on specific simulation needs.</p>

                    <h4>Key Contributions:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> Created ER and UML diagrams, designing tables in 3NF/BCNF
                            for efficient data organization and retrieval.</li>
                        <li><strong>SQL Implementation:</strong> Wrote SQL scripts for table creation, sample data
                            insertion, and common queries, such as locating alumni matching job profiles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Automations:</strong> Developed triggers to handle automatic transitions (e.g.,
                            moving graduates to the alumni database) and job posting expirations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Built access control systems for different user levels, ensuring
                            data protection and integrity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability & Backup:</strong> Proposed backup strategies and replication plans to
                            accommodate large user bases, including potential scaling to over a million users.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This project demonstrates my expertise in database systems, automation, and problem-solving,
                        tailored to meet organizational needs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To analyze the role of digital forensics in modern vehicle systems
                        and its implications for security, privacy, and investigation.</p>

                    <h3>Key Highlights:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Autonomous Systems & Data:</strong> Explored how modern vehicle systems collect data
                            (e.g., speed, location, braking) for operational efficiency and forensic purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Forensic Tools:</strong> Studied tools like Berla Corporation's iVe, which extract
                            data from black boxes and infotainment systems, aiding accident reconstruction and criminal
                            investigations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy Challenges:</strong> Critiqued the risks of data misuse by unauthorized
                            entities, especially regarding sensitive information like location and synced device logs.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Future Outlook:</strong> Examined the need for robust security measures in
                            multi-layered vehicle architectures to mitigate vulnerabilities and protect users.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This paper demonstrates my ability to connect technological advancements with forensic
                        applications, addressing both societal benefits and ethical concerns.</p>
